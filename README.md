# twitch-digits

A visual breakdown of twitch.tv popularity sorted by game. Hosted at [http://digits2.twitch.pub](http://digits2.twitch.pub). This is a rework of the [original twitch digits app](https://github.com/pBun/twitch-digits-old) that I made over 2 years ago.

## Local development

You'll need [node](http://nodejs.org/download/).

Install your local deps with `npm install` and you should be set.

#### Go go go.

Build, serve, and watch:
```
npm run dev
```

Source files in `/src` compile to `/`.
